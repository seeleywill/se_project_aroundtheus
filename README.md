**Intro**

This project features JavaScript code, which introduces a pop-up window that enables the user to edit the name and description of the profile. The cards are now made with a template, which is cloned and populated with data from an array.

This project was built upon Project 3, which was made with a responsive layout, so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Flexbox and media queries are both used.
